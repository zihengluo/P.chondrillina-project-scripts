Divide the genome-wide SNPs into subsets based on contigs with command line:

Get all the contigs names into a list called contig_names, 
get the header of every vcf file into vcf_header, 
divide the whole vcf into subset files, 
each one contains SNPs of one contig.

'''
grep -v "^#" input.vcf | cut -f1 | sort | uniq > contig_names
grep "^#" input.vcf > vcf_header

while read line
do
grep -v "^#" input.vcf  | awk -v contig=$line '{ if ( $1==contig ) print }' | cat vcf_header - > $line.vcf
done < contig_names
'''

Create directories for each SNPs subset and move each subset into its directory,
This step will make it easy to import SNPs into R studio by Popgenome

'''
for %i in (*) do mkdir "%~ni"
for %i in (*) do move "%i" "%~ni"
'''
