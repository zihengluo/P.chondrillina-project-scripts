IQ-TREE multicore version 2.0.3 for Linux 64-bit built Dec 20 2020

1, convert vcf to phy https://github.com/edgardomortiz/vcf2phylip

'''
python vcf2phylip.py -i myfile.vcf
'''

2, test the assumptions of stationarity and homogeneity.

'''
iqtree2 -s myfile.phy --symtest-only
'''

3, create phylogenomic tree

# +ASC: ascertainment bias correction model
bias, systematic deviation of population genetic statistics, caused by 
sampling a nonrandom set of individuals or by biased SNP discovery protocols. Unless the 
whole genome of every individual in a population is sequenced there will always be some 
form of SNP ascertainment bias. +ASC will correct the likelihood conditioned on variable
sites. Without +ASC, the branch lengths might be overestimated. doi:10.1002/bies.201300014

# GTR: general time reversible model assumes different rates of substitution for each pair of nucleotides, 
in addition to assuming different frequencies of occurrence of nucleotides.https://doi.org/10.1016/C2012-0-07153-0

# if without -st DNA, ERROR: File not found GTR.
IQ-TREE mis-detected your alignment because the fraction of A,C,G,T characters is too low, which is not surprising with SNP data. 
You can use option -st DNA to override this (incorrect) auto-detection.GTR+ASC model automatically filter out all invariant sites.
